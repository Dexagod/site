achievements:
  - name: Finalist Belgian Olympiad in Informatics (beOI)
    description: The Belgian Olympiad in Informatics is a yearly competition where high school students are tested on their problem solving skills. The first round is purely logical thinking and barely any programming. The students that make it through this round get some coaching/training weekends for the final round, which revolves around competitive programming. In the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 I made the finals of this competition.
  - name: Winner Cybersecurity Challenge Belgium (CSCBE)
    description: The Cybersecurity Challenge Belgium is, as the name implies, a challenge revolving around cybersecurity. Students over the age of 18 are invited to solve as many challenges as possible, in a capture-the-flag like competition. Every step, the highest-scoring teams make it to the next step. The winners of the finals get (among other prizes) a trip to DEFCON in Las Vegas. In 2022, my team "tetramonohedrons" won and got to take home the victory.
